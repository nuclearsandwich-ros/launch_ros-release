ros-verystable-test-launch-ros (0.7.0-2bionic) bionic; urgency=high

  * Fixed a bug to ensure that shutdown event is handled correctly (#154 <https://github.com/ros2/launch/issues/154>)
    * There was a potential race condition in between when the shutdown event is emitted and the rest of the shutdown handling code.
    * This introduces an additional await to ensure that the event is emitted before proceeding.
  * Added support for passing parameters as a dictionary to a Node (#138 <https://github.com/ros2/launch/issues/138>)
  * Made various fixes and added tests for remappings passed to Node actions (#137 <https://github.com/ros2/launch/issues/137>)
  * Added ability to pass parameter files to Node actions (#135 <https://github.com/ros2/launch/issues/135>)
